# ml-from-scratch
All things classical ML: every algorithm explained, implemented, and dissected for fun. Projects, C implementations, and occasional nerdery included.


This repo is a full-blown investigation into classical machine learning. Every algorithm gets explained, implemented, broken, debugged, rebuilt, and occasionally rewritten in Câ€”just to prove a point.

What's inside
Intuitive explanations of ML algorithms

Python implementations with comments that don't lie

C implementations when I'm feeling spicy

Mini projects and experiments

My notes, mistakes, and moments of crisis

Resource lists from courses, books, and the abyss of the internet

Why this exists
Because sometimes you want to understand how the model works, not just call .fit() and hope for the best. This is where I figure things out, take notes, and build intuition through chaos.

Who should care
You're learning ML and want to go deeper

You like understanding things instead of memorizing them

You think debugging is a personality trait

You might want to port ML to a toaster someday

Status
Ongoing. Unhinged. Educational.
