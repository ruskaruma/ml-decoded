# ML-From-Scratch

**Building brains out of math and code.**  
A full investigation into classical machine learning — every algorithm explained, implemented, broken, debugged, and sometimes rewritten in C just to prove a point.

## What's Inside

This repo is my hands-on lab for classical ML.  
Expect a curated mix of:

- Intuitive, math-backed explanations of ML algorithms  
- Python implementations with no-BS comments  
- C implementations when abstraction gets in the way  
- Mini projects and chaotic experiments  
- Debugging logs, mistakes, and insight dumps  
- Paper readings and implementation attempts  
- Resource lists from books, courses, and deep web dives

## Algorithms (Planned & In Progress)

### Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forests  
- Naive Bayes  
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, AdaBoost)

### Unsupervised Learning
- K-Means Clustering  
- Hierarchical Clustering  
- DBSCAN  
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Optimization + Utilities
- Gradient Descent (SGD, Momentum, Adam)  
- Loss functions and regularization  
- Cross-validation and model selection  
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC)

## Paper Implementations & Reading Logs

When docs aren’t enough and blogs are too vague.

- Walkthroughs of foundational ML papers  
- Step-by-step paper implementations  
- Notes from:
  - *A Few Useful Things to Know About Machine Learning*  
  - *The Elements of Statistical Learning* (selected topics)  
  - Original algorithm papers (SVM, kNN, Decision Trees, etc.)

---

## Why This Exists

Because `.fit()` is not the same as understanding.  
This is where I:

- Rebuild everything to understand how it actually works  
- Use C when Python feels too cozy  
- Make mistakes, hit bugs, and learn by fixing  
- Take real notes—sometimes mid-crisis  
- Turn confusion into clarity (eventually)

---

## Who This Is For

- You’re learning ML and want to go deeper  
- You care about how things *actually* work  
- You enjoy low-level clarity and high-level intuition  
- You treat debugging as a core learning tool  
- You might one day port a model to a toaster

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-From-Scratch.git
   cd ML-From-Scratch
   
2. Set up the virtual enviornment:
   ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
   
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run any notebook or script in algorithms/ or projects/ and start experimenting.



## Status
- Ongoing. Unfiltered. Educational.
- Expect broken notebooks, sudden insights, and bursts of progress.
