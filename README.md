ml-from-scratch

Building brains out of math and code.
A full investigation into classical machine learning—every algorithm explained, implemented, broken, debugged, and sometimes rewritten in C just to prove a point.

What's Inside
This repo is my hands-on lab for classical ML.
Expect a curated mix of:

Intuitive, math-backed explanations of ML algorithms

Python implementations with no-BS comments

C implementations when abstraction gets in the way

Mini projects and chaotic experiments

Debugging logs, mistakes, and insight dumps

Paper readings and implementation attempts

Resource lists from books, courses, and deep web dives

Algorithms (Planned & In Progress)
Supervised Learning
Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Decision Trees

Random Forests

Naive Bayes

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, AdaBoost)

Unsupervised Learning
K-Means Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering

DBSCAN

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Optimization + Utilities
Gradient Descent (SGD, Momentum, Adam)

Loss functions and regularization

Cross-validation and model selection

Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC)

Paper Implementations & Reading Logs
When docs aren’t enough and blogs are too vague.

Walkthroughs of foundational ML papers

Step-by-step paper implementations

Notes from:

A Few Useful Things to Know About Machine Learning

The Elements of Statistical Learning (selected topics)

Original algorithm papers (SVM, kNN, Decision Trees, etc.)

Why This Exists
Because .fit() is not the same as understanding.
This is where I:

Rebuild everything to understand how it actually works

Use C when Python feels too cozy

Make mistakes, hit bugs, and learn by fixing

Take real notes—sometimes mid-crisis

Turn confusion into clarity (eventually)

Who This Is For
You’re learning ML and want to go deeper

You care about how things actually work

You enjoy low-level clarity and high-level intuition

You treat debugging as a core learning tool

You might one day port a model to a toaster

Status
Ongoing. Unfiltered. Educational.

Expect broken notebooks, sudden insights, and progress in bursts.
